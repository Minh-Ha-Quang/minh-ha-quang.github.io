### About me

My current research interests focus on machine learning and statistical methodologies using theories and techniques from Functional Analysis and related mathematical fields. In particular, I have been working on theories and methods involving reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), Riemannian geometry, Matrix and Operator Theory, Information Geometry, and Optimal Transport, especially in the Infinite-Dimensional setting.

### News

September 2022: I will be giving an invited talk at [IG4DS (International Conference on Information Geometry for Data Science)](https://www.dsf.tuhh.de/index.php/ig4ds/)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Minh-Ha-Quang/minh.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Minh-Ha-Quang/minh.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
