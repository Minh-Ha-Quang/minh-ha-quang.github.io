### About me

My current research interests focus on machine learning and statistical methodologies using theories and techniques from Functional Analysis and related mathematical fields. In particular, I have been working on theories and methods involving reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), Riemannian geometry, Matrix and Operator Theory, Information Geometry, and Optimal Transport, especially in the Infinite-Dimensional setting.

I received my PhD in mathematics from Brown University (Providence, RI, USA) and wrote my dissertation under the supervision of Stephen Smale. Before joining RIKEN, I was a researcher at the Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision group at the Italian Institute of Technology (Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia) in Genoa (Genova), Italy.
